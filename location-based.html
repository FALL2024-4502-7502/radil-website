				<h1>7 Best Delis in St. Louis</h1>
				<p>St. Louis is known for being a place with some of the best deli shops imaginable. Although all similar in fashion, each shop has its own unique atmosphere and taste. I decided to break down my very own list of the best delis in St. Louis below. </p>

									<h2>Adriana's on the Hill</h2>
									<address>
										5101 Shaw Ave.<br>
										St. Louis, MO<br>
										63110<br>
										<a href="tel:+13147733833">(314) 773-3833

									<p>"Adriana’s is a small family owned lunch cafe nestled in St. Louis’ Italian section of town,
									known as “The Hill.” The restaurant opened its
									doors in December of 1992 and is run by
									Adriana Fazio and her daughters.

									At Adriana’s it’s all about family.
									From the names of the sandwiches down to the recipes, Adri and her girls offer guests a little taste of their heritage." </p>

						<h2>Amighetti's</h2>
						<address>
							5390 Southwest Ave.<br>
							St. Louis, MO<br>
							63139<br>

						<p><a href="https://amighettis.com/">Visit Amighetti's website</a></p>
						<p>"The Amighetti Special is often called the best sandwich in St. Louis. The Special begins with bread still made fresh daily as it was in 1921 by Louis Amighetti Jr., using recipes that were brought from Italy. Inside the Special lies ham, beef, salami, brick cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepper and Amighetti’s own special dressing. The Special is Often Imitated but Never Duplicated." </p>

						<h2>Eovaldi's Deli</h2>
						<address>
							2201 Edwards St.<br>
							St. Louis, MO<br>
							63110<br>
							<a href="tel:+13147715707">(314) 771-5707</a>
						</address>
						<p><a href="https://www.delionthehill.com/">Visit Eovaldi's Deli's website</a></p>
						<p>"Eovaldi’s makes a tasty sandwich. The Extra Special (with roast beef, ham, mortadella, Genova salami, pepper cheese, let/tom/pickles, onions, pepper cheese, light mayo, and a squirt of the house Italian dressing) is as good as any poor-boy-style sandwich in town–and at $6.95 for 6 inches, it’s as good a value. Then there’s the Sicilian Bomber, a gussied-up “dip” sandwich dosed with bomber gravy, so named because of its tendency to drop bombs of the gravy’s components–sauteed onions, mushrooms, and red peppers." </p>

						<p><a href="https://momsdeli.com/">Visit Mom's Deli website</a></p>
						<p>"It all started back when Highway 44 was being developed, connecting downtown to West County. Forced to close their business due to the development coming right through their Edwards Avenue store on “The Hill”, Charles and Dolores Vago set their sites on a new business. On June 18, 1977, Mom’s Deli opened its doors for the first time. Selling sandwiches, fresh meats, groceries, beer, and wine, it quickly became a neighborhood favorite."</p>

These two simple goals are what has made P’sghetti’s so popular, and has been the foundation for our success over the years."</p>
